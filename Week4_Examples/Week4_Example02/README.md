## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 2: Level class (hard-coded grid)

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han

---

## Description

This sketch demonstrates how a 2D array represents a maze/game level changes the structure of the code so that "a level" becomes a reusable object.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- A class lets you bundle data (the grid) + behavior (draw, size helpers)
  into one thing you can reuse later (especially once you start loading
  multiple levels from JSON).

---

## Assets

N/A

---

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.
